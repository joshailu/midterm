## Summary
<hr>
I created a portfolio for myself that describes my career goals, interests, skills, and background. The theme is mostly pink and is relatively simple. It has three pages that serve to briefly introduce me, provide more information about myself, and display some of my projects. While the design is simple, the home page is easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing.
<br>
Furthermore, the pages are incredibly responsive, and utilize grids and flexbox extensively to ensure that they can be viewed from any device. I built it using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Since it is a relatively simple style, I opted to use Bootstrap's scripting functions instead of creating a separate JavaScript file.

## Pages
<hr>
There are three pages on my site.

### Home Page

- Displays my name, a brief introduction, and my profile picture in an easily visible style.
- Responds to smaller screen sizes by removing the profile picture.
- Includes a section with my LinkedIn, GitHub, and email contacts. The links are displayed as images with logos or symbols to distinguish them.
    - The LinkedIn and GitHub pages lead to their respective default pages because I did not want to link my personal contacts.

### About Page

- Displays an extended background on my past, present, and future (including career goals) to give readers a better idea of who I am.
- Two columns below the background provide brief descriptions of my skills and interests.
- There is a resume button at the bottom of the page to allow readers to learn more about my experiences.

### Projects
- Lists three personal projects in a grid format, with accompanying images and descriptions.
- Easily viewable on a variety of screens due to the grid format.
